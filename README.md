Fun With Socks
========

Small, but growing demo app, for demonstrating Socks Elixir Library.
Project can be located here: [Socks](https://github.com/gabeklein/Socks)


Socks is a small collection of helper modules indented to make it easier
to route and manage interactions between [cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy) web-socket connections and GenServer processes. Socks provides consistent abstractions which, for one, implicitly 
maintains or merges state of a process, be it socket delegate or GenServer actor. 

## What does the demo show?

Fun With Socks shows what Modules and Macros are available to users of Socks today. Use this project as a jumping off point, to get your own "Hello Worlds" off the ground! As minimalistic as possible, this is intended to show how little is needed to get up and running, a websocket connection from scratch!

## Installation

Get it with git:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gabeklein/Socks.git
cd Socks
mix deps.get
iex -S mix
```
